 Test Drive Booking
 - Users can book a test drive by selecting a date and time, and will receive an email upon completion of the form.

 Google Maps API integration
 - Users can book a test drive and specify where they'd like the car to be dropped off, giving the user a choice of manually typing an address or using the Google Maps API to automatically get it dropped off where they are located.

 Auto pagination
 - Rather than loading hundreds or potentially thousands of cars on the index page, there will be a set limit of cars to be displayed and once the user reaches the bottom of the page, more cars get rendered underneath
